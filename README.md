Remade And Revamped Version of Derpbot
REVAMPED YET AGAIN
added cogs and more optimised commands using discord.ext commands

Now Fully Supported

Prerequisites:
youtube-dl (pip install youtube-dl)

discord.py (pip install discord.py)

If you would like to run this on your server, use bot.py NOT bot EDGE.py
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed and the latest verion of discord.py
