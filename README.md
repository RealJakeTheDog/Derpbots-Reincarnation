# Derpbot

Remade And Revamped Version of Derpbot

REVAMPED YET AGAIN

added cogs and more optimised commands using discord.ext commands

Now Fully Supported

Prerequisites:
youtube-dl (pip install youtube-dl)
ffmpeg (i would recommend installing cocolatey and using coco install ffmpeg. I had a lot of problems getting pip to install ffmpeg)
discord (...)
discord.py (pip install discord.py)

If you would like to run this on your server, use bot.py NOT bot EDGE.py
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed and the latest verion of discord.py
You will need to create a bot on discordapp.com/developers and insert the token at Bot Token/Run


---------------------------------------------------------------------THIS REPOSITORY IS NOW DEPRECIATED--------------------------------------------------

The discord.py repository is no longer maintained and the bot has been moved to https://github.com/RealJakeTheDog/Derpbot and is now coded in JavaScript. You also now have the function to invite the bot directly instead of hosting your own with the source code.
